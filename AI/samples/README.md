# Setting Up Sample Directory

#### To setup this directory (`AI/samples`)
 - Unzip the `mnist.zip` file into this directory
 - Unzip each for the four compressed files
 - Run the `BCSV()` function from the `__init__.py` file from the root directory. ex: 

```
from AI import BCSV
BCSV()
```

 - This should make two `.csv` files in the `samples` directory with the training and testing data.
